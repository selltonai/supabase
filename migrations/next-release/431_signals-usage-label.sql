-- Migration: 431_signals-usage-label
-- Date:      2026-11-11
-- Purpose:   Signals billing (Borce 2026-11-11): the web app's Brain signal charges show as "Signals" on the usage page
--            and on the invoice, as the phone's do since 396, and a signal counts as one unit.
--              1. usage_analytics_projection_contribution (396): two additions, nothing else. In derived_task_label,
--                 metadata.service brain_signals or brain_signal_router gives 'Signals' (it was 'LLM generation'). In the
--                 units column, a brain_signals row (the poll's charge, one per new signal) counts 1; it had no
--                 emails, people or companies count, so its units were 0. Categories are as before: the charge stays
--                 b2b_data (Company data), the router's grading calls stay tokens (Research). mobile_signals is not
--                 touched (the phone's own work).
--              2. action_label_map, the same two services, label Signals, in the form of 396's mobile_signals row. Only the
--                 old analytics_usage_rollup (249) reads this table; the rollups v3 to v5 read the projection (1).
--            The Modal PR of the same change puts both services on the invoice line "Signals" (BillingService.ACTION_MAP)
--            and prices a web signal at cost x 3.
--            No re-projection of stored rows: production has no signal rows and the stage rows are test rows. A row
--            projected before this migration keeps its old label and units until it is projected again.
--            The function body is 396's (lines 23 to 258) byte for byte, plus exactly three added lines: the comment
--            `-- 431: Brain signals of the web app`, the `WHEN c.service_name IN ('brain_signals', 'brain_signal_router')
--            THEN 'Signals'` line and the `WHEN m.derived_category = 'b2b_data' AND m.service_name = 'brain_signals' THEN 1` line.
-- Projects:  selltonai-database/supabase (owner); readers: analytics_usage_rollup_v3, v4, v5 (the web usage pages and the
--            mobile service) through usage_analytics_projection_contributions.
-- Contract:  One function replaced, same signature (usage) and result type, so CREATE OR REPLACE keeps its grants and
--            the insert trigger that calls it. New rows in action_label_map. No table, column or trigger change.
--            Idempotent (OR REPLACE, ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE).
--            Merge order: this PR, then the Modal PR (fix/signals-billing-label-price), then the app PR
--            (fix/signals-price-words); none depends on another at runtime.
-- Depends:   public.usage_analytics_projection_contribution (345, 396), public.action_label_map (249), rows of 396.
-- Rollback:  rollback/431_signals-usage-label.rollback.sql (396's function text back, the two rows deleted).
